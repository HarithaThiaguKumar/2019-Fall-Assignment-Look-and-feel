Globally this has a greater effect on the coastal areas of all the continents.</h3></tr>

				<td class="description">The site can be used to find the current sea level along the coast and give you a visual image on how the further increase in sea level can have an effect on the coast. It can give us an approximate amount of land covered by the increase in sea level and the flooding of water as it penetrates the land.This site is presented with data from NOAA.

				<td class="description">The general nature of the changes that can occur on ocean coasts in response to sea-level rise are widely recognized. It is difficult, however, to forecast exactly what changes may occur in response to a specific rise in sea level at a particular location or point in time. The ability to forecast the extent of these changes is limited by uncertainties in both currently available data that describes the coastal environment, as well as gaps in understanding of some of the driving processes that contribute to coastal change. The USGS has developed two methods that describe the vulnerability of a coastal region to sea-level rise: a Coastal Vulnerability Index, and probabilistic assessment of shoreline change that uses a Bayesian network approach.

				<td class="description">The FEMA Modeling Task Force (MOTF) is a group of modeling and risk analyst experts from FEMA Regions VIII (Denver) and IV (Atlanta) that may be activated by the FEMA NRCC for Level 1 events in support of disaster response operations.  The group consists of individuals with experience in multi-hazard loss modeling and impact assessments, including earthquakes, hurricanes, riverine and coastal floods (surges, tsunamis), winter storms and others.  The MOTF plays an important role in coordinating hazard and modeling information from a variety of sources, including other federal agencies, universities, the National Labs, and State and local agencies, to develop consensus for best estimates of impacts before, during, and after events.  The MOTF integrates observed information throughout disasters to “ground-truth,” verify, and enhance impact assessments.

				<td class="description">NOAA, in partnership with FEMA, USACE, USGCRP, and CEQ has created a set of map services and related tools to help communities, residents, and other stakeholders consider risks from future sea level rise in planning for reconstruction following Hurricane Sandy. Even if current storm patterns remain the same in the future, sea level rise will increase the impact of coastal flooding during storms. We have resources that help us quantify current risk, such as FEMA’s Most Recent Flood Hazard Data for affected areas of New York and New Jersey, but these do not provide information on future risks.
