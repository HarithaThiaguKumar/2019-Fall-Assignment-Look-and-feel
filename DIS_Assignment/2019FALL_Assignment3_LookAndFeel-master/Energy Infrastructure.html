			<tr><h3>The climate change also affects the Energy Infrastructure. In an effort to enhance future energy security and the underlying knowledge foundations, the Energy and Infrastructure Resilience theme contains federal data, tools, and publications that inform various aspects of how energy and infrastructure systems could be impacted by climate change as well as how they might adapt to become more climate resilient. Citizens, businesses, non-governmental agencies, governments, and research institutions may find improved accessibility to these resources useful in better understanding and preparing for climate-related impacts on energy and infrastructure.</h3></tr>

				<td class="description">The Energy Department has selected seven projects that will accelerate the commercialization of innovative offshore wind technologies in the United States. Each project will receive up to $4 million from the Energy Department to complete the engineering, site evaluation, and planning phase of their project. Upon completion of this phase, the Energy Department will select the up to three of these projects to advance the follow-on design, fabrication, and deployment phases to achieve commercial operation. Each of the these projects will be eligible for up to $47 million in additional funding over four years, subject to Congressional appropriations.

				<td class="description">Natural gas is a fossil energy source that formed deep beneath the earth's surface. Natural gas contains many different compounds. The largest component of natural gas is methane, a compound with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH4). Natural gas also contains smaller amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL; which are also hydrocarbon gas liquids), and nonhydrocarbon gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor. We use natural gas as a fuel and to make materials and chemicals.
