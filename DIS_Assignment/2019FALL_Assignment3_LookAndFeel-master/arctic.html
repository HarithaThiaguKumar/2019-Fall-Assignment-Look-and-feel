			<tr><h3>The Arctic is warming at a rate twice the global average, according to the 2018 Arctic Report Card. Warming temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost are having profound impacts on Arctic ecosystems, as well as Arctic residents and their ways of life. Changes in the Arctic are also impacting other parts of the world as melting glaciers contribute to global sea-level rise and warming temperatures in the Arctic latitudes affect global weather patterns.</h3></tr>

				<td class="description">Changes in sea ice affect activities ranging from subsistence hunting and coastal travel to community safety and the use of ice as a platform by industry. There is a need for information about sea ice conditions at spatial-temporal resolutions higher than those from the National Weather Service. Alaska coastal communities from Dillingham to Nuiqsut, marine navigators, coastal managers, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Navy, and scientists—as well as those in the fishing, tourism, and offshore resource extraction industries—have expressed a need for an atlas that would provide such information.Please click on the link for further information <a href="https://aoos.org/ice-atlas/">Sea Ice Atlas </a></td>
